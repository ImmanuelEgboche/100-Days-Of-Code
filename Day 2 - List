#A list can be created with either 
example = list()
example = []

primes = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]

print(primes)

#Values can be added using the append function

primes.append(19)
primes.append(23)
print(primes)

#Indexing allows you to recall specfic parts of the list.
#Indexing starts from 0 onwards 

print(primes[2])
print(primes[-2])

#Slicing allows you to recall a range of values via indexing
#Slicing includes the starting index but not the last

#Another aspect of python is that you can combine list together however
#order is very important cadding lists together is concatenation

number = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

print(number+primes)
#in reverse 
print(primes+number)
