## To I looked at creating lists in numpy 
##The first thing i tasked myself with was creating a 1D array as seen below 

import numpy as np

list = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

print(list)

##This  creates a 2D array with all 1's in a 3 by 3 format 
import numpy as np 

ones= np.ones((3,3),  dtype=int)

print(ones)

## This created a array from 1 to 10 where only the odd numbers are recalled.
import numpy as np

Odd=np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])
oddnumbers=(Odd[Odd%2==1])

print(oddnumbers)

##Similar to the above code. This Code is created to recall all odd number and subtracted them with -1
import numpy as np

Odd=np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])
oddnumbers=(Odd[Odd%2==1])

print(oddnumbers)

print(oddnumbers - 1)

##This is a reshape code in the form of 2 across and 6 down 
import numpy as np
array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12])
print(array)
dim = array.reshape(6, 2) 

## This code selects a pre set range between 1-10 and 11-20 i then reshaped both then multiplied and added them together
import numpy as np

a = np.arange(1,10).reshape (3,3)
b = np.arange(11,20).reshape (3,3)
print(a,b)
ans =np.dot(a,b)
print(ans)
anz=np.sum(ans)
print(anz)
